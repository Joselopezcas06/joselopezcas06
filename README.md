# Hi there, I'm José 👋  

I’m an engineer with a focus on **structural analysis** and **parametric design**.  
Since 2021, I’ve been working in structural and CAD departments, helping design systems that are more efficient, reliable, and optimized.

## 🚀 Why I'm here  

I’m passionate about continuous learning—whether it’s applied mathematics, computing, or mechanics.  
Expanding my skills in programming, software development, and data analysis has been key for me to bridge **engineering and technology**, creating tools that push both fields forward.  

At the end of the day, engineering isn’t about a title—it’s about solving problems, understanding and creating knowledge, and advancing technology to make the world better. 🌍
